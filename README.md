# **Slice Image Viewer**

## ðŸ‘‹ About Slice

**Slice is an image viewer inspired by the deprecated Picasa Photo Viewer and built with electron from cross-platform operation on *Windows, macOS, and Linux*.**

Slice is being developed with the following goals in mind:

- **Aesthetic** - Slice aims to provide a simple and graceful UX and a slick, professional UI.
- **Speed** - The goal of the project is to provide a desktop class experience wherein the application should open, function, and close quickly and smoothly
- **Compatibility** - Expanding on the capabilities of Picasa Photo Viewer, Slice is intended to support a variety of image formats not supported by its predecessor including animated GIFs, JFIF, and WEBP.
- **Organization** - In addition to a simple image viewer, Slice will allow user to scroll through all images in a directory and contain a directory view for easier browsing.
